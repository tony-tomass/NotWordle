  The totally-not clone of Wordle! This is made for Assigment #4 in my CSC-2990 Mobile App Development class where we were to make an app based on the game Wordle that draws from a Firebase database for its word bank.

  Task
</h2>

> Create a wordle clone app named Wordy. Wordle is a game in which a five-letter word is chosen and the
playerâ€™s goal it to guess the chosen word within six tries. After every guess, each letter is marked as either
green, yellow or gray: green indicates that letter is correct and in the correct position, yellow means it is in
the answer but not in the right position, while gray indicates it is not in the answer at all. Multiple instances
of the same letter in a guess, such as the "o"s in "robot", will be colored green or yellow only if the letter
also appears multiple times in the answer; otherwise, excess repeating letters will be colored gray. Further instructions
can be viewed via the PDF file.
